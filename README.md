# leaflet-challenge
This is my solution to homework 15 for data boot camp

## Overview
In this project, using Leaflet and USFS GeoJSON data, I created a world map looking at earthquakes that have happened in the past week. The Map will show the locations of each earthquake with a circle marker. The size of the circle depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the color depends on the depth. There is a color legend that correlates with the depth. When you click on the marker a pop-up will appear that will tell you where the earthquake happened and its magnitude.

To use this code for yourself, clone the repo and then open the folder in VisualStudio Code. Right-click on the index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
